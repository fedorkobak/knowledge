    "\n",
    "A crusial step in validating the machine learning model is splitting the data: the model is trained on the one split and validated on the other. This approach allows ensures that the model's good performance isn't just due to overfitting - memorizing the entire training dataset - but rather, it's due to the identification of general rules that accurately describe the process under consideration.\n",

    "- **train**: a set of data that is used training a model.\n",
    "- **valid**: a set of data on which all the different models will be estimated during the experimentation phase.\n",
    "- **test**: a set of data that is used to estimate the final model. This step is necessary to eliminate the bias associated with the process of selecting optimal hyperparameters.\n",

    "- **Cluster**: Selects the entire group instead of individual points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-validation** is an approach in which a train-test split is performed multiple times. Each time, the model is trained from scratch using each training set and evaluated using each testing set. There are few typicall approaches how to perform a cross-validation:\n",

    "- **K-Fold**: Define $k$ different, non-overlapping test subsets. The remaining data for each test subset is considered training data.\n",
    "- **Stratified K-Fold**: In each train-test split, there is a strata that are proportional to those in the entire dataset.\n",
    "- **Time-series**: In each split, the data is separated according to the timming of the observations. Earlier data goes to the training set, and later data goes to the test set."
