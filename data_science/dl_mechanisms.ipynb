    "Recurrent is an approach to processing typically sequential units of data. The main idea is to use information about how previous elements of the sequence were processed to process the following ones.\n",

    "Mathematically it can be written:  \n",

    "$$h_t = f(x_t W^T_1 + b_1 + h_{t-1} W^T_2 + b_2)$$\n",

    "- $x_t$: input at the $t$-th step.  \n",
    "- $h_t$: vector that describes hidden state at the $t$-th step.  \n",
    "- $W_1$: weights associated with the input.  \n",
    "- $W_2$: weights associated with the state.  \n",
    "- $b_1$: bias associated with the input.  \n",
    "- $b_2$: bias associated with the state.  \n",
    "- $f$: activation function, typically a hyperbolic tangent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $h_t$ depends on $x_t$ and $h_{t-1}$. But $h_{t-1}$ depends on $x_{t-1}$ and $h_{t-2}$, and so on recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "All these computations, resulting in $h_t$ for $t = \\overline{1,n}$, can be used in the subsequent steps to describe the process we are interested in.\n",
