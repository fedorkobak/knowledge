    "An ambulance crew went on a call to a segregated neighbourhood. Unfortunately, when the dispatcher received the call, he only had time to write down the house address and the number of flat $K_1$, and then the connection was cut off. However, he remembered that at the same house address some time ago an ambulance had travelled to flat $K_2$, which is located in entrance $P_2$ on floor $N_2$. It is known that there are $M$ floors in the house and the number of flats on each landing is the same. Write a programme that calculates the number of staircase $P_1$ and the number of floor $N_1$ of flat $K_1$.\n",
