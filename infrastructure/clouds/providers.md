### Endpoint

In order to deploy your solution to production, you may need to create an endpoint that will be requested by other components of the system. There are two ways to do this:

- **Kubernetes online endpoints:** Users manage the k8s cluster which provides the necessary infrastructure.
- **Managed online endpoints:** Azure Machine Learning manages all the underlying infrastructure. This is a standard approach for machine learning engineers.

### Azure AI Foundry

In Azure AI Foundry, you must create a **hub**: is a workspace that organises and connects all the resources, tools, and services you use to build AI solutions. Within the hub, you can define **projects**, which provide more specific access to model and agents development.
