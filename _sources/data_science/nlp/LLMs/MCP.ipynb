    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows LLM to connect with external data sources, tools, and environments. This enables the seamless transfer of information and capabilities between AI systems and other digital tools. The MCP standardizes the method to interacting with LLMs, enabling tool builders to create a simple tool that can be used with any LLM."
