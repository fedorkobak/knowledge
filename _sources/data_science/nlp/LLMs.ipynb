    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows LLM to connect with external data sources, tools, and environments. This enables the seamless transfer of information and capabilities between AI systems and other digital tools. The MCP standardizes the method to interacting with LLMs, enabling tool builders to create a simple tool that can be used with any LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the architecture of MCP, which follows the rules determined by the role of each compoment, makes it easier to build LLM-based applications. There are 3 components in model that uses MCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Host**: the application that is supposed to interact with the LLM.\n",
    "- **Client**: the compoment of the host that establishes a connection with the MCP server.\n",
    "- **Server**: external process that establishes the capabilities of the LLMs through the MCP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP, you can build the integration you want. But there are typical usecases which is called **capabilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool**: These are executable functions that the model can use to perform actions.\n",
    "- **Resources**: Read-only sources of information.\n",
    "- **Prompt**: Pre-defined prompt templates that define the way host provide the integration wiht LLM.\n",
    "- **Sampling**: Server-initiated requests for the Client/Host to perform LLM interactions, enabling recursive actions where the LLM can review generated content and make further decisions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The entire LLM system can contain many modifications around the LLM, such as prompts that defines the system's behaviour, RAG approach, etc. There are a number of ways to evaluate the quality of the entire LLM system. In context of the text generation, it's difficult to evaluate the system using the determenistic algorithms. Ideally, you would hire a humans to estimate system's responses. This approach is extremely expensive, so it is common practice to use an LLM to evaluate the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few typical approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pairwise comparison**: If you have two approaches for generating a response, you can collect information on which output was better.\n",
    "- **Evaluation by criteria**: To estimate how good the output of the system was according to the specified criteria. You can select a criteria according.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Providing a reference**: Different stages of the system can accumulate different types of information. This is typically used during the evaluation stage. For example, in the evaluation framework you can provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input that lead to the output which quality we are trying to estimate.\n",
    "- Prepared ground truth answer.\n",
    "- The conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details check the [LLM-as-a-judge: complete guide to using LLMs for evaluation](https://www.evidentlyai.com/llm-guide/llm-as-a-judge).\n",
