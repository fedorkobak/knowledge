## Agile

The Agile is to approach for software development that relies on the following principles: you have to give more value to

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Communicating with customers over negotiating contracts.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

There two main frameworks that follows Agile principle: Scrum and Kanban.

### Scrum

In Scrum, work involves iterative improvements to the software. Each iteration takes from one to four weeks and is called a *sprint*. There are:

- **Events**: periodical meetings or other organisational ceremonies that are usually tied to a particular phase of the software development.
- **Artifacts**: the things to be done. Separated into few groups typically: *backlog*, *to do*, *in process* and *done*.
- **Roles**: 
    - *Product owner*: person responsible for communication with the customer.
    - *Scrum master*: person that checks that scrum rules are followed.
    - *Scrum team*: people who complete the tasks.

### Kanban

Kanban just takes from scrum the groups of tasks: *to do*, *doing* and *done*.
