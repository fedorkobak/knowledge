# Knowlege

Website provided by Fedor Kobak, with various studies in data science, computer science and related fields.

This site is mainly based on [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) converted to the site using the [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/build.html) tool.

Of course, it imposes some restrictions on the content of the site, but any page that was generated from the ipynb file can be downloaded and play with it yourself.

For pages that use a lot of bash you should use the bash kernel. To install it use:

```bash
pip install bash_kernel
python -m bash_kernel.install
```
