# Ranking task

Some sources distinguish the ranking task as a separate class of machine learning tasks.

## Formal task description

Let's denote:
- Set of the abstrac objects as $O=\{o_i\}_{i=1}^n$;
- Set of the items as $I=\{i_j\}_{j=1}^m$.

For specific object $o_i$ we need to define order of items $I'$ such where the most relenant elements is on the top.
