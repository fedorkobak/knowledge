    "    - **Note** To print `HEAD->master` in jupyter notebook output you have to use the `--decorate` option for some reason, in terminal this is not necessary;\n",
    "- I stored the hash of the first commit in the `first_hash` variable and printed it;\n",
    "- Using `git checkout $first_hash` I moved `HEAD` to `first commit`, which means it's now an active commit:\n",
    "    - **Note** In real work you can use the hash of the commit and don't use a variable to store the commit hash;\n",
    "    - **Note** by default `git checkout` prints it's message to the error stream, so I used `2>&1` to redirect it to the out stream;\n",
    "- By calling `git log` again, I showed:\n",
    "    - That `(HEAD)` is now next to the `first commit` message;\n",
    "    - The `second commit` isn't even shown now - git's default behaviour for `git log` is to show the history of the commit that created the head commit. Use the `--all` option to show all messages;\n",
    "- `ls` will show that there is no `second file` in the project folder now - it's ok, we've moved to a commit where there is no such file;\n",
    "- `cat first_file` shows that the first file is still the same as it was in the second commit:\n",
    "    - This is because we reverted git to `first_commit` but not the working directory. In `git status` you can see that `first_file` is marked as `modified`, it is indeed different from the commit that HEAD is currently referring to;\n",
    "    - To return a file to the state as in `first commit` you simply need to do a `git restore` for that file, which is what I am doing and demonstrating the `first_file` from `first commit`."
