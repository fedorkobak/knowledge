    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way to structure code by organizing it into objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints that define the behavior and characteristics of the objects. Python is an object-oriented programming language that fully supports OOP principles."
