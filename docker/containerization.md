# Containerization 

This page explains the theory behind the containerization.

**Container** is a method of delivering applications to production.

**Container image** bundles an application along with its runtimes, libraries, and dependencies together.

**Container orchestrator** is a tool that groups containers together and meets the following requirements:

- Fault-tolerance.
- On-demand scalability.
- Optimal resource allocation.
- The ability to identify one another.
- Accessibility from the outside world.
- Seamless update rollbacks without the downtime.
