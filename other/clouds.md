There are a services that allow you to rent computers and run programs on them.

## Responsibility models

There are different models of cloud services. They differ based on what is done the customer's end and what is done on the prvider's side:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides just computers and their internet connection.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): The provider is responsible for the operating system, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): The entire application building process is handled by the provider.

The following picture shows the diagram that describes the options provided by different responsiblity models.
