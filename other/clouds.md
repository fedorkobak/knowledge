# Clouds

There are a services that allow you to rent computers and run programs on them.

## Responsibility models

There are different models of cloud services. They differ based on what is done the customer's end and what is done on the prvider's side:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides just computers and their internet connection.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): The provider is responsible for the operating system, middleware, development tools and business intelligence services.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): The entire application building process is handled by the provider.

The following picture shows the diagram that describes the options provided by different responsiblity models.

## Cloud models

There are three types of cloud models:

- **Private cloud**: The company owns the entire cloud. This means that all computational resources are aligned to the company. However, if the company does not need all the awailable computational resources at a given moment, it still pays for the entire cloud.

- **Public cloud**: Different companies can use the same computational resources, which allocated to those who need them more in a moment. This prevents extra consts as you only pay for the computatioins you use.

- **Hybrid cloud**: A company runs some services on a private cloud and others on a public cloud. The decision ususally depends on the particular needs of the service and regulations.
