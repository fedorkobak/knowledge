    "| **SQL File Task** | Executes a SQL script file stored in the workspace or a Git repository. | Running complex SQL transformations, DDL, or DML statements. |\n",
    "| **Python Script Task** | Executes a Python file on the cluster using `spark-submit`. | Running standard Python code, often with Spark (PySpark) libraries. |\n",
    "| **Python Wheel Task** | Runs a Python function packaged within a Python Wheel (`.whl`) file. | Running production-grade, modular, and version-controlled Python code. |\n",
    "| **JAR Task** | Executes a compiled Java or Scala application packaged as a JAR file. | Running compiled, production-ready code, typically for complex logic. |\n",
    "| **Spark-Submit Task** | Allows submission of a generic Spark application via the `spark-submit` command. | Running custom or highly specialized Spark applications. |\n",
    "| **dbt Task** | Runs one or more `dbt` (data build tool) commands. | Orchestrating and running dbt projects for data transformation. |\n",
    "| **Run Job Task** | Executes another Databricks Job as a task. | Creating nested, modular, or reusable workflows (Parent-Child jobs). |\n",
    "| **If/Else Condition Task**| Evaluates a condition and controls the execution flow of subsequent tasks. | Adding conditional logic (branching) to a workflow. |\n",
    "| **For Each Task** | Iterates over a collection of input values and runs a nested task for each value. | Parallel processing or batch operations over a list of items. |\n",
    "| **Dashboard Task** | Updates a Databricks SQL Dashboard. | Automating the refresh of business intelligence dashboards. |\n"
