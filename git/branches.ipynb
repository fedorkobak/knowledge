    "| 2. Three-Way Merge (or True Merge) | Occurs when the target branch has new commits (i.e., the branches have diverged). This matches the scenario you described in your first question. | Git compares the two branch tips and their common ancestor (merge base) to combine changes. A merge commit is created, which has two parent commits, preserving the history of both branches. |\n",
